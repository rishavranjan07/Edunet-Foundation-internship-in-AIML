# Water Quality Prediction
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

## Overview
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

## Technologies Used
<ul>
<li>Python 3.12</li>
<li>Pandas, NumPy – Data handling</li>
<li>Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation </li>
<li>Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization </li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation </li>
</ul>

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters
The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:
<ul>
<li> NH4 </li> 
<li> BOD5 (BSK5) </li>
<li> Colloids </li>
<li> O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and </li>
<li> CL </li>
</ul>

## Model Performance
The model was evaluated using:
<ul>
<li>R² Score</li>
<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
</ul>
Performance was acceptable across all parameters
